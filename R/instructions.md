# === R Markdown Program: [Program Name] ===

📌 **Description**  
[Describe what this `.Rmd` file does — e.g., statistical analysis, data visualization, etc.]

---

## 🖥️ Requirements

- R installed (should be preinstalled in the Codespace)
- R packages: `rmarkdown`, `knitr`, and any others your `.Rmd` depends on

## ▶️ How to Render the R Markdown File (GitHub Codespaces)

1. Open the repository in your GitHub Codespace.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the R folder:

    ```bash
    cd R
    ```

3. Render the `.Rmd` file to HTML:

    ```bash
    Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('your_file.Rmd')"
    ```

    Example:
    ```bash
    Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('analysis.Rmd')"
    ```

4. The output (e.g., `analysis.html`) will be saved in the same directory. Open it in the preview pane or download it.

## 💡 Notes

- Make sure to install all required packages inside the Codespace if needed:

    ```R
    install.packages("tidyverse")  # Example
    ```

- You can also render within RStudio if running locally or in a GUI.
